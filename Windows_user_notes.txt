Getting tusk to run correctly on windows was a bit frustrating, I did however find a fix so I can now install jake build cappuccino ect  ect.

The fix involved copying narwhal.cmd, narwhal-rhino.cmd, and tusk.cmd into the system 32 folder (from the correct paths), so they can be seen, and modifying the narwhal.cmd script to point to the right directory.



The error I was getting on tusk calls in command:

cant find executable for rhino

(I tried various installs, numerous path changes, file moving inclusions ect to try and get a working combination of files, but it just didnt work, so it became clear this issue had to be related to the actual tusk.cmd)

So I dug into the tusk.cmd script and made sure I know what path it is actually pointing to before assuming

Then I went into the narwahl.cmd script. 

This is because rhino is within narwhal, in order for rhino to run, it needs to go thru here 1st.

So I check these paths in narwhal.cmd

Here is where I found that narwhal wants to connect to another command script.

the script declared that NARWHAL_ENGINE=rhino

set EXECUTABLE_NAME=narwhal-%NARWHAL_ENGINE%.cmd

So ofc we want to make sure it sees" narwhal-rhino.cmd" ^

narwhal-rhino.cmd is the script we want to run for the rhino.exe

But since we cant find it...we need to see why.

add all the parameters to the echo on error. ex:

	echo narwhal home: %NARWHAL_HOME% 
	echo engine home: %NARWHAL_ENGINE_HOME% 
	echo Can't find exe for %NARWHAL_ENGINE% 
	echo of narwhal-%NARWHAL_ENGINE%.cmd
	exit /b 1

copy this new narwhal.cmd into C:/windows/system32

run tusk at command, now all of the parameters should be listed.

In my case narwhal.cmd had this:
narwhal home: C:\Windows\System32    ----this isnt right 
		-we want to point this script to the parent of the narwhal bin directory
engine home:                                                   ---and ofc this wont work either becuase of the path
cant find exe for rhino
of narwhal-rhino.cmd


so I changed  NARWHAL_HOME to my narwhal parent directory ( the one above the bin dir /  in my case it was....)
set NARWHAL_HOME=C:\Narwhal\narwhal


and now jake works on my xp machine.
